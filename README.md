**`CSULA Student and Coding Enthusiast`**

I am a Computer Science student attending California State University, Los Angeles. I like to learn new languages, frameworks, and tools to help me create games, apps, and web applications. I am very passionate about what I do and make sure to have fun while doing it. Some coding projects are built from scratch and others are from tutorials.
